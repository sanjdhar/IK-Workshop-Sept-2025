# Lab 02 - Simple Agentic AI Job Finder

Build an agentic job search system designed to help professionals in any field find a job. The system should use specialized agents and multiple search strategies to find the best positions matching an individual's skills, experience, and any other preferences (salary, location, remote only, etc.).

## Guidance by track

- Expert Track: You are free to use any agentic framework and LLM of your choice to achieve the outcomes and functionality described above
- Intermediate Track: Switch to the `intermediate` branch
- Novice Track: Switch to the `novice` branch

## Some hints
- This lab solution uses CrewAI as the agentic framework along with Gemini as the LLM
- Use a modular design with specialized agents (Eg. Job Analyst, Career Strategist, etc) and multiple search strategies to find the best positions matching an individual's skills, experience, and any other preferences (salary, remote only, etc.)
- Keep the app CLI based. Adding web UI can be a stretch goal once you have a working app
