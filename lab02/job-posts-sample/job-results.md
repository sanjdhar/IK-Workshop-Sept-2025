        Applications close:
    **Required Skills:** JavaScript, React
    **Experience Level:** 2-5 years (specifically mentions 5 years for preferred, and 3 years for Drupal experience, which falls within the 2-5 year range).

I need to refine the list to only include jobs that explicitly state or imply 2-5 years of experience. I will re-evaluate the descriptions for each.
The "Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)" at SS&C explicitly states "2-5 years of experience".
The "Founding Full-Stack / Platform Engineer" at Amadeus Search explicitly states "2-5 years fullstack experience".
The "Software Engineer (Web)" at Plaid explicitly states "2-5 years of experience".
The "Software Engineer - Full Stack" at Anon explicitly states "2-5 years of full stack engineering experience".
The "Front-End Web Developer" at Prolificgiving explicitly states "2-5 years professional experience in web development".
The "Software Dev Engineer II" at TekWissen LLC explicitly states "2-5 years of relevant experience".
The "Senior, Software Engineer (Front End)" at Walmart mentions "Bachelor's degree... and 3 years’ experience" as a minimum qualification, which fits the criteria.
The "Front End Software Engineer" at Intelliswift Software explicitly states "Minimum 2-5 years of relevant experience in industry."
The "Web Architect Lead" at California State University mentions "5 years of experience in the following: a database structured query language, a high-level programming language, user support. Minimum of 3 years’ experience with Drupal CMS design and development." This also falls within the 2-5 year range for relevant experience.

I have 9 job postings that fit all the criteria. I can now format the final answer.

One job posting, "Founding Full-Stack / Platform Engineer" by Amadeus Search, has a salary range of $220k - $280k which is above the specified $190k max salary. I will exclude this job.

The "Senior, Software Engineer (Front End)" by Walmart has a salary range of $117K–$234K. The lower end is within the $80k-$190k range.
The "Web Architect Lead" by California State University has a salary range of $109,992.00 - $117,840.00, which is within the $80k-$190k range.
