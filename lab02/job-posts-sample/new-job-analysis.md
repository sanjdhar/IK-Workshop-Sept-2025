Here's a comprehensive analysis of the job data to provide targeted recommendations for an intermediate Software Engineer candidate with 2-5 years of experience, targeting a salary of $80,000 - $190,000.

The job market analysis reveals several promising roles for an intermediate Software Engineer focusing on Python, JavaScript, and React. The "Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)" at SS&C stands out as a strong match, directly requiring Python, JavaScript, and React, along with experience in automation frameworks, Docker, and cloud platforms, aligning well with the candidate's skill set and offering a clear path in quality assurance and automation leadership. Similarly, the "Software Engineer (Web)" at Plaid and the "Software Engineer - Full Stack" at Anon are excellent fits, heavily emphasizing JavaScript and React, with Anon also highlighting Node.js. While the "Senior, Software Engineer (Front End)" at Walmart has "Senior" in its title, its minimum experience requirement of 3 years (within the 2-5 year range) and its strong emphasis on JavaScript, React, and Node.js make it a highly relevant opportunity for growth and leadership. These roles leverage core frontend and backend skills while providing exposure to crucial modern technologies.

Analyzing the required versus preferred skills, JavaScript and React are almost universally present in these intermediate-level roles, forming the bedrock of frontend development. Python appears less frequently but is present in roles like the SDET at SS&C and the Front-End Web Developer at Prolificgiving, offering a chance to utilize this language. Opportunities to develop preferred skills like Node.js are abundant, notably in the Anon and Walmart positions, indicating a strong demand for full-stack capabilities. Similarly, exposure to cloud platforms like AWS is a common requirement or preference in roles at SS&C, Plaid, and TekWissen LLC, along with Docker in SS&C and Walmart, which are critical for modern software development and deployment pipelines.

Regarding salary and career progression, the identified opportunities largely align with the $80,000 - $190,000 expectation. For instance, SS&C offers $120,000 - $145,000, and Intelliswift Software's hourly rate translates to approximately $146,500 annually. The California State University's "Web Architect Lead" role falls within $109,992 - $117,840, and Walmart's "Senior, Software Engineer" has a broad range where the lower end ($117,000) fits perfectly. These positions, particularly the Senior Engineer and Web Architect Lead roles, offer clear pathways for growth in software engineering, moving towards technical leadership, architectural design, and team mentorship, which are key to advancing a career in the tech industry.

To capitalize on these opportunities and further advance, focusing on strengthening proficiency in Node.js for backend development and gaining hands-on experience with containerization (Docker) and cloud services (AWS) is highly recommended. While Python is beneficial, deepening expertise in JavaScript and its ecosystem (including Node.js) will open more full-stack roles. The market trends clearly show a demand for engineers who can work across the stack, understand CI/CD pipelines, and leverage cloud infrastructure. For career progression into technical leadership, developing skills in system design, architectural patterns, and mentoring junior engineers will be crucial. Projects involving microservices, API design, and performance optimization will also be highly valued.
