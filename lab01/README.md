# Lab 01 - Build Simple AI agent
The goal of this lab is to build an agentic app that can list, read, write, and answer questions about files on your local Mac/PC file system.

Hint: You will need to use tools to equip your agent

## Example prompts the app shoud be able to successfully process
- List all files in my current folder
- Read the contents of my `notes.txt` file and give me a summary
- Write "Hello, World!" to a new file called `hello.txt` in my current folder
- Read the file `app.py` in my current folder and explain what this code does

## Guidance by track
